# Conan - Android Content Monitoring & Blocking App

**Conan** is an Android application designed to support **digital wellness** and **productivity** by monitoring and blocking content across installed apps. Using Android‚Äôs Accessibility framework, Conan detects potentially problematic content and responds with interventions such as overlays or alerts.

## üìå Purpose & Scope

Conan helps users maintain focus and avoid triggering or distracting material by:
- Monitoring screen content and foreground apps
- Displaying emergency overlays to block harmful content
- Alerting users when detection thresholds are reached

It is especially useful for:
- Individuals seeking digital detox or content moderation
- Users with focus issues or content-trigger-related sensitivity
- Productivity-focused routines (e.g., study or work sessions)
